Trying to improve the health of everyone on the planet is the aim of the Sustainable 
Development Goals or   SDGs, which last year replaced the Millennium Development Goals. 
The first analysis of the SDGs has put places like Iceland and Singapore at the top 
and war-torn Syria and South Sudan at the bottom.   Devi Sridhar, Professor of Global 
Public Health at the University   of Edinburgh, says the targets provide a good basis 
for planning where   to invest scarce resources.
